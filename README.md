# GUICandlesticks
This program is a simple GUI with the Tkinter library. The plan of this project is to start a GUI with interactive candlesticks with python. For now, I only added a chat window, a message window, and a scrollbar to the GUI. My goal of this project is to add actual candlesticks to the GUI and make the candlesticks interactive.
